INLINE STYLES
Although CSS is a different language than HTML, it's possible to write CSS code directly within HTML code using inline styles. To style an HMTL element, you can add the style attribute directly to the opening tag. After you add the attribute, you can set it equal to the CSS style(s) you'd like applied to that element.

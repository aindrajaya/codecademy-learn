YOUR FIRST COMMAND
The command line is a text interface for your computer. It's a program that takes in commands, which it passes on to the computer's operating system to run. From the command line, you can navigate throught files and folders on your computer, just as you would with Finder on Mac OS or Windows Explorere on Windows. The difference is that the commmand line is fully text-based. The advantage of using the command line is its power. You can run programs, write scripts to automate common tasks, and combine siple commands to handle difficult tasks- making it an important programming tool. This course is for unix-based systems such as Linux and Mac OS X. And appendinx of all commands taught in this course is available.

#**ls
What is going here?
[ls
2014 2015 hardware.txt]
1. In the terminal, first you see $. This is called a shell prompt. It appears when the terminal is ready to accept a command. 
2. When you type ls, the command line looks at the folder you are in, and then "lists" the files and folders inside it. The directories 2014, 2015, and the file hardware.txt are the contents of the current directory. 
ls is an example of a command, a directive to the computer to performt a specific task.

#Filesystem
A filesystem organizes a computer's files and directories into a tree structure:
1. The first directory in the filesystem is the root directory. It is the parent of all other directories and files in the filesystem. 
2. Each parent directory can contain more child directories and files. Here blog/ is the parent of 2014/, 2015/, and hardware.txt.
3. Each directory can contain more files and child directories. The parent-child relationship continues as long as directories and files are nested.
You're probably already familiar with this tree structure- Mac Finder and Windows Explorer represent the filesystem as trees as well.

#pwd
[$pwd
/home/ccuser/workspace/blog]
pwd stands for "print working directory". It outputs the name of the directory you are currently, called the working directory. Here the working directory is blog/. In Codecademy courses, you working directory is usuallly inside the /home/ccuser/workspace/ directory. Together with ls, the pwd command is useful to show where you are in the filesystem.

#cd l
[$ cd 2015]
1. cd stands for "change directory". Just as you would click on a folder in Windows Explorer or Finder, cd switches you into the directory you specify. In other words cd changes the working directory.
2. The directory we change into is 2015. When a file, directory or program is passed into a command, it is called an argument. Here the 2015 directory is an argument for the cd command.
The cd command takes a directory a name as an argument, and switches into that directory.

#cd II
[# cd jan/memory]
To navigate directly to a directory, use cd with the directory;s path as an argument. Here, cd jan/memory/ command navigates directly to the jan/memory directory.
[# cd ...]
To move up one directory, use cd .. . Here, cd .. navigates up from jan/memory/ to jan/. Make sure you are in the directory /home/ccuser/workspace/blog/2015/jan by using the command pwd.

#mkdir
[$ mkdir media]
The mkdir command stands for "make directory". It takes in a directory name as an argument, and then creates a new directory in the current working directory. Here we used mkdir to create a new directory named media/ inside the feb/directory.

#touch
[touch keyboard.txt]
The touch command creates a new file inside the working directory. It takes in a filename as an argument, and then creates an empty file in the current working directory. Here we used touch to create a new file named keyboard.txt inside the 2014/dec/ directory. 
The commands we’ve covered so far are commonly used to navigate the filesystem. There are more commands you can use to master the command line, and we’ll cover them in the next lessons. Let’s summarize what we’ve done so far.

#Review
Congratulations! You've learned five command commonly used to navigate the filesystem from the command line. What can we generalize so far?
1. The command line is a text interface for the computer's operating system. To access the command line, we use the terminal.
2.  A filesystem organizes a computer's files and directories into a tree structure. It starts with the root directory. Each parent directory can contain more child drectories and files.
3. From the command line, you can navigate through files nd folders on your computer:
--> pwd outputs the name of the current working directory
--> ls lists all files and directories in the working directory
--> cd switches you into the directory you specify
--> mkdir creates a new directory in the working directoy
--> touch creates a new file inside the working directory

QUIZZZ
-------------
1. If the current working directory is home/media/music, which of the following commands will navigate to the home/ folder in the tree below?
[home/
    media/
        movies/
        music/]
REA: Correct! ../.. moves the current working directory up two levels.
ANS: cd ../..

2. How would you change to one directory above the current working directory?
REA: Correct! cd changes directories, and .. is one level up.
ANS: cd ..

3. What does the following command do?
[touch media/popular.txt]
REA: Correct! touch creates a file, media/ is the directory of the file, and popular.txt is the filename.
ANS: It creates a file named popular.txt in the media directory

4. What is a directory?
REA: -
ANS: A folder used to store files

5. How would you create a file named text.txt in your current directory?
REA: Correct! touch is the command to create files and text.txt is the name of the file.
ANS: touch text.txt

6. If the current working directory is home/, which of the following commands will navigate to the movies/ directory in the tree below?
REA: Correct! cd is used to change directories.
ANS: cd media/movies

7. How do you print the current working directory?
REA: Correct! pwd stands for Print Working Directory.
ANS: pwd

8. Define filesystem.
REA: Correct! You can see filesystems represented in the Mac Finder and Windows Explorer.
ANS: It organizes a computer's files and directories into a tree structure
